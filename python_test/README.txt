This is where I'm testing a version of the UI that runs on Python instead of C.
The processor should have plenty of spare power to be able to make up for the inefficiencies of Python.
Python provides a much friendlier way of programming the UI, and should allow less experienced programmers
to contribute to the development of arcticOS.
