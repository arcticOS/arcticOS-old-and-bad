About arcticOS:
	arcticOS is a free (GPL3) operating system that is designed
	to run on low-power devices like microcontrollers and 
	dumbphones.
	
	By default, it has a minimalist phone UI that
	can be easily replaced or adapted into whatever you need - 
	whether that be a clock UI, touchscreen interface, or status
	monitor.
	
	It uses a unique, semi-cooperative multitasking scheme that is
	easy to work with, even on the low level.
